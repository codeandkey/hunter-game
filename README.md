# hunter-game
This beautful Markdown README does not mean anything yet.
This game is in development and is barely playable.

hunter-game uses tds-engine, which can be found on my GitHub profile.

## compile

To compile the game, you must have premake4 installed.
Make sure that you have compiled tds-engine and installed it.
Execute `premake4 gmake` to generate the makefile.
Execute `make` to compile the game in debug mode.
Execute `make config=release` to compile the game in release mode.
